### What all I ** learned** ?

I started the challenge with **basic** HTML, CSS & **intermediate** Python knowledge. My portfolio  a blank slate. During the **challenge** I learnt **HTML , CSS & Javascript** , built many projects alongside it. It didn't take me much time to grasp **basics** of Javascript so I could skip to the **important** stuff.

I **struggled** in the algorithmic part, I feel that struggle improved my ** problem-solving skills** a ton. I love **fetching** APIs and playing around with data. I started learning **node** for server-side && **Svelte & Sapper** too. 

> The challenge helped me in making a **habit** to code **consistently**

### What all I **gained**?

- I made **many** new mentors.
- I made **many** friends that I can ping anytime.
- I understood the **importance** of being **consistent**
- I understood **burnouts** are real and taking breaks is **important**
 
### What will I be doing in Round 2 ?
